## 📂 Project Structure

- `Excel_Project.xlsx` — The Excel workbook containing the dashboard, data, charts, and calculations.  

---

## 🔍 Purpose & Features

This Excel dashboard project is designed to:

- Consolidate raw data for meaningful analysis  
- Provide interactive visualizations (charts, tables, KPIs)  
- Track and display key metrics clearly  
- Help users make data-driven decisions  

Key features included:

1. **KPI Tiles** — Highlight important business metrics at a glance  
2. **Trend Charts** — Line charts to show how metrics evolve over time  
3. **Category Breakdown** — Pie/bar charts to break down performance by category  
4. **Dynamic Filtering** — Drop-down filters or slicers to drill down into specific data segments

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Open the Workbook**: Launch `Excel_Project.xlsx` in Microsoft Excel (preferably a modern version that supports slicers and dynamic charts).  
2. **Enable Content**: If Excel prompts you to enable content, click **Enable Editing** / **Enable Content** so that macros / pivot tables (if any) work properly.  
3. **Explore the Dashboard**:
   - Use slicers / filters to change views.  
   - Navigate between different sheets (e.g., Dashboard, Data, Raw Data).  
4. **Update the Data**:
   - Go to the Data sheet and input or paste new data.  
   - Refresh pivot tables or charts (if you have pivot-based visuals) to reflect changes.  
5. **Save Your Changes**: After updating data or visuals, save the workbook. You can also export charts or dashboards as images.

## 💡 Tips & Next Steps

- Consider adding more advanced Excel features like **Power Query** or **Power Pivot** if you want to handle larger or more complex datasets.  
- You could also build a **dashboard in Power BI** in the future for better interactivity.  
- Document data sources and assumptions somewhere in the workbook (a dedicated “Documentation” sheet is a good idea).
